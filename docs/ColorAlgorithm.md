# Colour algorithm

This page describes how UnderBlue corrects underwater colour. It is for developers who change the colour pipeline.

## Purpose and product rules

- Analysis measures the scene. `ColorCorrection.make(analysis:preset:plan:)` turns the measurements into named values. It is the one pure mapping. `FilterEngine` only applies values.
- Inside `make()` the rules run in a fixed order: `SceneFactors` (haze, deep, bright, highlight, neon, waterType, cast, restore, mean, water) once, then `baseCastGains`, `presetSaturation`, the user's saturation, `waterRules`, `toneRules`, `presetRules`, the user's temperature, the mid-tone clamp and the white reference. `baseCastGains` and `presetSaturation` return one value. The other helpers write their own values, and their doc comments list them.
- Preset values are read in several helpers, not only in `presetRules`. See [Built-in presets](#built-in-presets).
- Photo, batch and video share one entry point: `RestorationEngine.combined`.
- We use our own simple, explainable logic. General optics is fine. We do not copy research code or tables.
- Target look: clear cyan-to-blue water, warm natural subjects, more contrast and clarity, slightly brighter. Not grey, not violet or indigo, not neon.
- Order: particle and noise removal come before colour correction. Sharpening and deblur come after them.
  - The bright-scene reference-adaptation contribution now removes noise before its channel gains
    (29 Sep 2026; see [m5 evaluation](M5ColorEvaluation.md)). The other contributions still have
    no noise removal, and there is no deblur.
  - Sharpening does run: two unsharp masks and the [fine detail layer](#clarity).
  - Sharpening can still amplify noise in contributions without prior denoising. See [Open problems](#open-problems-and-next-tasks).

## Pipeline overview

1. `FilterEngine.analyze` measures a `WaterAnalysis`.
2. A depth map and `WaterModelEstimator.estimate` give a `RestorationPlan`.
3. `ColorCorrection.make` runs twice. Without a plan it gives the values for the source image. With a plan it gives the values for the restored image.
4. `RestorationEngine.combined` builds two results:
   - `current`: the finishing stage (`FilterEngine.finishing`) on the source image, blended by intensity.
   - `depthAware` (the restored path): the restoration kernel, then the finishing stage, blended by intensity.
   - The finishing stage ends with the [highlight shoulder](#highlight-shoulder) on both paths.
5. The output blends `current` into `depthAware` per pixel. The weight is `physicalWeight` (the plan confidence) times a ramp over depth: 0 at depth 0, full at `RestorationEngine.nearDepth` (0.25). Kernel: `UnderBlueDepthBlend`.
   - A low-confidence fit gives almost exactly `current`.
   - The nearest pixels also get `current`. The restoration leaves them almost unchanged, but the restored values are made for the restored water. On the O3 sunfish belly (depth 0), the restored water tone turned cyan into green: hue 150 without the ramp, 200 with it (commit `9a92ca5`).
   - A depth map with a range of 0.05 or less (the constant-depth video plan) uses one weight for the whole frame.

If there is no plan, or the restoration render fails, the output is `FilterEngine.apply` alone (`PhotoProcessor.processed`). Fallback codes are in [Diagnostics](Diagnostics.md#restoration-fallback-codes).

- **Photo:** one image, one analysis, a per-pixel depth map.
- **Video:** see below and [Video V2](VideoV2.md).
  - Keyframes: one about every second, from 0 s to 0.1 s before the end. At least 10, at most 120, so a one-hour clip gets one every 30 s (`VideoRestorationAnalyzer.keyframeTimes`).
  - Scenes: `VideoSceneSplitter` starts a new scene when a keyframe's mean colour is far from the running scene mean: more than 0.04 in OKLab distance. The next keyframe must be that far too, so one odd keyframe never starts a scene.
  - Each scene drops odd keyframes (`sceneInliers`) and averages the rest (`sceneMean`). Depth and the water fit run on at most 10 keyframes per scene. Each scene gets one analysis, one plan and one constant depth.
  - A scene whose fits all failed borrows the whole clip's plan.
  - Between two scenes the values cross-fade over at most 1 s (`VideoRestorationAnalysis.moment(at:)`, smoothstep). Each scene gets its own `make()` result, and the results mix.

## Analysis values

`FilterEngine.analyze` reads a 48x48 thumbnail, tone-mapped to SDR. It skips pixels with luminance at or below 0.015 or at or above 0.85.

| Field | Meaning | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| `redLoss` | 1 - red / mean(green, blue) | Red boost in `castGains`, `redRebuild`; red attenuation prior, red recoverability and red gain limit in `WaterModelEstimator` |
| `cyanDominance` | Same value as `redLoss` | Green and blue attenuation priors in `WaterModelEstimator` only |
| `exposure` | (0.22 - median luminance) x 0.6, from 0 to 0.12 | `brightness` |
| `contrast` | Luminance p90 - p10 | `haze` (low contrast = haze), which feeds tone, saturation, shadows and clarity |
| `saturation` | Mean (max - min) / max | `vibrance` (less vibrance for colourful scenes) |
| `meanRed/Green/Blue` | Scene mean colour (linear) | Green-to-blue cast shift, `castStrength`, exposure-neutral gains, restored-path `subjectRed` and `midLift` |
| `midLuminance` | Median luminance | `deep`, `bright`, `tonePivot`, `midLift` goal |
| `waterRed/Green/Blue` | Mean of the least red third of pixels (mostly open water) | `waterType`, water tone target, `neon`, `violetGuard`, `waterRedness`, `waterChroma`, red gate |
| `neutralRed/Green/Blue` | Mean colour of the white-reference candidates (see [White reference](#white-reference)). Zero means none were found. | `neutralGains` |
| `neutralShare` | Share of analysed pixels behind that colour | Evidence for `neutralGains` |
| `highShare` | Share of lit pixels (luminance above 0.015) at luminance 0.35 or above. Clipped pixels count too. | The highlight rule in `brightness`, `shadowLift` and `midLift` |

Derived values: `greenOverBlue`, `waterColor`, `neutralColor` and `castStrength`. `waterColor` falls back to the scene mean. `castStrength` is 0 for a neutral scene mean and 1 for a clear cast.

## ColorCorrection values

All values come from `ColorCorrection.make`. The finishing kernel `UnderBlueFinishColor` applies the cast, subject light removal, water tone and red values. It also applies `midLift`, `toneCurve` and `tonePivot`. Core Image filters apply the other tone values and clarity. `waterType` only feeds other values: it is `SceneFactors.waterType`, read by `baseCastGains` and `waterRules`. `RestorationEngine.combined` uses `physicalWeight`.

### Cast and water tone

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `castGains` | Per-channel gains: red boost plus a green-to-blue shift. The shift acts only when green/blue > 0.88, and scales with cast and `waterType`. Mean luminance is kept, within a correction factor of 0.8 to 1.25. A pale pixel without a cast keeps its own colour; see [Pale surface light](#pale-surface-light). |
| `waterType` | 0 = blue water, 1 = green or teal. Continuous. The water colour's own red loss (not the `redLoss` field) adds to green/blue, so teal counts as green. A neutral scene gets 0 (`waterType(_:)`). |
| `waterTone` | Gains that move water-like pixels toward the OKLab target from `waterTarget`. |
| `subjectTone` | Gains for pixels that are not water-like: red 1, green and blue at or below 1. See [Subject light removal](#subject-light-removal). |
| `waterSaturation` | Chroma scale for water-like pixels. Below 1 calms neon water. |
| `waterRedness` | Red / (green + blue) of the water. Redder pixels count as subject and are not toned. |
| `waterChroma` | Normalised chroma of the water. Much greyer pixels (silver fish, sand, a diver) count as subject. |

`waterTarget` moves the hue to azure, OKLab 240 (`waterHueGoal`), in full. The market look puts every clear-water scene near one azure: the AquaColorFix outputs sit at 239 to 242 on four of five pairs. Only the chroma limits and the solver bounds hold a scene back. Before 28 Sep 2026 the hue moved halfway toward 238 inside a 222 to 262 band, which left indigo-leaning water at 246 to 257. Near-grey water and colours that are not water keep their hue. `waterCorrection` solves the gains with a coarse grid, damped Gauss-Newton steps, then a short pattern search (without it the solve stopped about 1.5 degrees short). Gains stay in 0.35 to 2.2; the old floor of 0.45 held the blue gain at its bound on deep blue water.

Deep, dark, hazy water keeps more of its colour: the chroma floor for murky water (`murkyFloor`) is 0.22 divided by the later-step factor, up from 0.14. The market look keeps a deep blue background deep (AquaColorFix pair 2: chroma 0.30 to 0.23; ours was 0.17, now 0.20).

The water-like weight uses a chroma test. The test is off below `waterChroma` 0.55 and fully on above 0.8 (`chromaConfidence`). So in murky water, compression steps do not become grey patches. Strongly coloured water still protects greyer subjects such as silver fish. It is a per-pixel rule in the kernel: no inference, blur pass or frame buffer.

### Subject light removal

Subjects are lit through the same water, so they carry its colour: blue, or green in green water. The red boost alone left a reef violet and a white belly mint (AquaColorFix pairs 2, 4 and 5, 26 Sep 2026). So pixels that are not water-like lose part of the water's colour.

- `subjectTone` = (1, (Lr / Lg)^k, (Lr / Lb)^k). L is the water colour after the cast gains (`waterLit`). k is `subjectLightRemoval` (0.4) times `SceneFactors.cast`. That is the larger of `castStrength` and a ramp of the water's OKLab chroma (0 at 0.03, 1 at 0.08). So a colourful reef with a neutral scene mean still counts as cast when the water is clearly blue. `waterTone` and `waterSaturation` are raised to the same power, so a scene with little cast gets almost no water tone. Green stays in 0.6 to 1 and blue in 0.35 to 1. Green never rises. Water with less green than red left no green to give back, and extra green turns a fish lime.
- The kernel applies it by (1 - water-like weight), at the pixel's own luminance.
- Green and blue never fall below the pixel's red. A grey subject carries no cast, so it is not made warm; a silver fish stays silver. Beige sand under blue water lands exactly on grey.
- Blue keeps at least its share of green (blue/green of the pixel before the removal). The removal takes more blue than green, so a cyan-lit pale surface would otherwise end green.
- A bright pixel that the white reference made nearly grey skips the water saturation and the water tone. The fade runs over pixel chroma (max - min) / max from 0.35 down to 0.15. As a cast on grey, those values read violet or green.
- A grey scene has grey water and gets gains of one.

The white reference below reads the result, so a neutral surface needs less from it.

### Pale surface light

Water takes red first. So a source pixel whose red already reaches green lost no red. Examples are light on the water surface, a reflection of the sky, or a sunlit highlight. The cast gains and the restoration's red recovery still pushed such pixels to pink or lavender. In a shallow shark photo (3 Oct 2026), the water surface went from 4.2% pink or violet pixels in the source to 28.5%.

- The weight is `FinishingMath.uncast`, read on the source pixel. It is the product of two parts:
  - red/green from 0.92 to 1.0
  - pale: chroma (max - min) / max from 0.3 down to 0.15
- Finishing: the pixel keeps its source colour at the luminance the cast gains give it.
- Restoration: `keepWarmRatio` keeps the restored red at or below green times the source red/green. See [Restoration kernel](#restoration-kernel).
- Colourful red subjects (chroma above 0.3) and blue-cast pixels (red below green) keep their full correction.
- Only the `castGains` step and the restoration are covered. The later finishing steps still add some pink. On the shark surface, restoration alone gives 3.2%. The full output gives 11.3%. Before this change, turning off saturation and vibrance, or the black offset, each removed about 5 points.
- The test photos are in `DeveloperMedia/shallowwater/`: the shark (surface light, caustics on sand) and a cave (light rays, bubbles).

This is not a caustics rule. Caustics on sand had no pink or violet pixels before this change (0%), and they still have none.

### Bright-scene reference adaptation (29 Sep 2026)

`referenceGains` and `referenceStrength` add a conservative alternative for subjects in bright
blue-water scenes with a broad white reference. The old red-from-green rebuild and subject
channel floors can pull different subject colours toward similar grey/beige results; on m5 the
purple and blue chart patches expose that loss. This alternative preserves measured channel
differences with diagonal gains in linear sRGB, then converts back to linear Rec. 2020.

- Evidence rises from a neutral share of 0.06 to 0.18, and median luminance 0.18 to 0.28.
  Strength also follows cast confidence and `(1 - waterType)`. Dark scenes and green water keep
  the established correction. No image name, chart coordinate or reference-image pixel is read.
- As with the white reference, the restored path reads its reference at depth percentile 35.
  A reference with a missing channel (linear sRGB minimum at or below 0.015), or a warm one,
  cannot enable this adaptation. Gains map the reference to its channel geometric mean and
  stay within 0.25 to 8. The geometric mean reduces the bright veil without adding red from green.
- The existing neutral-surface weight selects pixels. Very dark pixels fade in over linear
  luminance 0.04 to 0.16; bright, pale pixels retain more of the established highlight treatment.
  The green exposure anchor fades the adaptation out over linear sRGB 0.8 to 0.9: near clipping,
  its measured ratios no longer reliably describe the surface.
- Only the adapted contribution reads `CINoiseReduction` (noise level 0.04, sharpness zero),
  before the channel gains. This is not a general denoiser before physical restoration, nor a
  temporal video denoiser. Water and the other colour contribution retain their existing input.
- For adapted surfaces, the black offset uses a smooth channel toe instead of a hard subtract
  and clip. It maps zero to zero while retaining small channel differences. The corresponding
  share of contrast/brightness is removed from the later `CIColorControls`, avoiding double
  application. The colour-matrix fallback retains the original controls.
- Metal and the CPU mirror implement the same per-pixel rules. The CPU mirror accepts the
  denoised reference pixel separately; it does not reproduce the spatial noise filter. Video
  scene interpolation carries both new values.

This is a measured improvement, not an assertion that the Sea-thru target has been reproduced.
See [M5ColorEvaluation.md](M5ColorEvaluation.md) for per-region results and remaining regressions.

### Red rebuild and guards

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `redRebuild` | Red added as a share of green. Larger in blue and teal water, smaller in strongly green water. |
| `redGateLow`, `redGateHigh` | Green/blue range where the rebuild starts. The low edge sits 30% above the toned water's green/blue, so the water gets no red. It stays between 0.2 and 0.8 in blue water. In green water it is at most 0.55. So the gate stays low enough for a teal-lit face or hand. |
| `subjectRed` | Red/green of the toned water. On the restored path, it is halfway to the scene mean. Redder pixels get more rebuilt red. |
| `redCeiling` | Rebuilt red stops at this share of green. Fixed at 1.05; `make()` does not change it. |
| `violetGuard` | Strength, 0 to 1. In blue pixels, gains may not lift red above the larger of green and the pixel's own red. In water-like pixels, red stops at green, weighted by this strength. It is 0 when the "water" colour is not a colour open water can have (`waterPlausibility`). An example is a magenta anemone. |

The rebuild also fades out for strongly green pixels, from green/blue 1.35 to 2.2. So weed does not turn yellow.

### White reference

Sand, rock or a white belly should come out near grey. `ColorCorrection.whiteReference` finds gains that do this.

A candidate pixel for the reference must be:

- outside the least red third, so not open water
- in the brightest 20% of the scene
- at least 1.25 x as bright as the water
- no more colourful than the water: OKLab chroma at most 1.1 x the water's, and at most 0.2

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `neutralGains` | Gains that move `neutralColor`, as the finishing stage sees it, toward grey. One means no reference. Red may rise up to 3x; green and blue may fall to half and never rise (before the luminance normalisation). Luminance is kept. |
| `waterLit` | The water colour after the cast gains. The kernel uses it to find lit subjects inside water-like pixels. |

The gains act only when all of these hold:

- Evidence: from 1% of the scene, full at 6%.
- What is left on the surface after the normal correction is pale: OKLab chroma under 0.10, none from 0.18. The candidates are the bright, low-chroma surfaces, so a pale remainder of any hue is a cast. A colourful remainder is a real colour, such as a yellow fish, and is kept.
- The gains only remove a cool cast. Before the luminance normalisation red is 1 to 3 and green and blue 0.5 to 1. A warm remainder gets gains of one: it is a real colour, or the restoration's own red. This replaced the old hue window (150 to 235) on 28 Sep 2026; the window also rejected the lavender remainder of a blue-lit fish.
- A strongly blue candidate is trusted. A white belly, a grey fish or sand lit by blue water is as blue as pale water near the surface, and no colour test tells them apart. The open water is safe because the kernel applies the gains by `neutralWeight`. Before 28 Sep 2026 such a candidate was rejected, which left the pair 2 fish and the pair 3 mola without a reference.

On the restored path the candidate is first restored at the depth that 35% of the depth map lies below, because a lit surface is usually nearer than the water. The 35% is a simple rule, not a measured one.

The kernel applies the gains by `FinishingMath.neutralWeight`. Water-like pixels get none, so the water keeps its colour. The exception is a pixel 1.3 to 1.8 x brighter than the water and of another chromaticity, like the manta belly. Brighter water of the water's own colour gets none.

### Tone and brightness

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `midLift` | Restored path: gives back light lost with the veil, the backscatter haze that the water adds. It never lifts the median luminance above 0.22. The highlight rule lowers that ceiling to 0.132, and on both paths it may take the lift down to -0.12: the scene is exposed for its bright subject. |
| `toneCurve`, `tonePivot` | S-curve on gamma luminance around the scene median. Weaker for bright scenes. The automatic value is halved (`curveSoftening` 0.5, 28 Sep 2026), so it is at most 0.15. Custom Contrast can take it up to 0.3. |
| `brightness` | `exposure` x 0.45 (`CIColorControls`). The highlight rule halves it. Minus the veil offset: `veilOffset` (0.08) x (1 - `waterType`) x a ramp of the median luminance (0 at 0.2, 1 at 0.3 and above). |
| `contrast` | Preset contrast (1.04) plus 0.05 x haze (`CIColorControls`). |
| `saturation` | Preset saturation plus haze. Neon water gets a little less. |
| `shadowLift`, `highlightAmount` | `CIHighlightShadowAdjust`. `shadowLift` is 0.2 plus 0.15 x haze plus 0.1 x bright (0.28 plus 0.22 x haze before 28 Sep 2026); it reaches the mid-tones too, and the market look sits 3 to 6 L* lower there. The highlight rule keeps 40% of its haze part. `highlightAmount` is 0.92 minus 0.2 x haze: every lift pushes the highlights up, and the market look keeps them 5 to 10 L* lower. |
| `warmth` | Tropical only: `DivePreset.warmth` (600 K) x min(1, 4 x `castStrength`), so a grey scene gets none. Custom adds the user's Temperature. |
| `vibrance` | Preset vibrance, lower for colourful or neon scenes. |
| `physicalWeight` | Restored path only: the plan confidence. |

**Highlight rule.** A large bright area (a white belly, sunlit sand) already lights the scene. So the scene gets less lift, and its mid-tones may go a little darker (`midLift` down to -0.12). The rule's weight rises from `highShare` 0.02 to 0.07. It fades out in two cases:

- dark scenes (median luminance 0.18 down to 0.10), where a few bright spots do not light the scene
- contrasty scenes (`contrast` 0.35 to 0.5), whose deep shadows need the lift

**`CIColorControls` works on linear values.** The working space is linear Rec. 2020. Measured on 28 Sep 2026 with a one-pixel probe:

- `brightness` is added to the linear value. -0.08 takes every pixel below linear 0.08 to zero or below.
- `contrast` pivots at linear 0.5, not at the mid-tones. So 1.08 takes every pixel below linear 0.037 to zero.
- So `contrast` and `brightness` together are a linear gain plus a black offset. On market pair m2, contrast 1.09 subtracts 0.045 and brightness adds 0.046, so they nearly cancel.
- The names do not say this. It explains the rejected "brightness 0.45 to 0.3" test: without the offset, the contrast step crushed the shadows.
- No visible black crush was measured: m5 has 4.44% of pixels at or below 3/255, Sea-thru 4.15%.

### Clarity

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `clarity`, `clarityRadius` | Fine unsharp mask. Stronger in haze. Scaled by `localSoftening` (0.6) since 28 Sep 2026. |
| `definition`, `definitionRadius` | Broad unsharp mask for the veil over far water and reef. Also scaled by 0.6. |
| `detail`, `detailFloor`, `detailRadius` | Fine detail layer (kernel `UnderBlueDetail`, mirror `FinishingMath.detail`): the pixel's gamma luminance minus its own small blur, added back on subjects. See below. |

Radii are shares of the short image side, so every size looks the same.

The two unsharp masks change luminance only (kernel `UnderBlueLumaTransfer`). The pixel keeps its colour from before the masks, scaled to the sharpened luminance. On RGB the masks sharpened colour noise too.

**Fine detail layer.** AquaColorFix's images carry about 40% more fine-detail energy than ours did. The difference sits at the pixel scale, not in the broad unsharp masks: its block-local contrast is lower than ours. So a last sharpening step runs after the two unsharp masks:

- The layer is the difference between the pixel's gamma luminance and a Gaussian blur of it. The blur radius is `detailRadius`, 1.2/480 of the short side: 2 px on a 1200 px photo, 7.6 px on a 4032 px export.
- Differences below `detailFloor` (0.004, doubled in dark scenes) get nothing. The strength ramps up to full at 3 x the floor. From `FinishingMath.detailEdgeLow` (0.15) the layer fades and at `detailEdgeHigh` (0.30) it is off, so an outline gets no halo. In between, texture is amplified by `detail`.
- The layer lands where the white reference lands (`FinishingMath.neutralWeight`): subjects, and pale surfaces clearly brighter than the water. Open water gets nothing. The colour kernel's plain water-like weight was tried first and cut the mola and the manta out, because a pale body lit by blue water is water-like.
- Dark pixels fade in from linear luminance 0.02 to 0.06: they carry the most noise.
- The pixel is scaled by one factor, so hue and chroma stay, and a pixel at or above luminance one is unchanged.
- `detail` = `ColorCorrection.fineDetail` (1.3) x (1 + 0.25 x haze) x (1 - 0.5 x deep) x the Custom Clarity factor. Video gets one value per scene like every other value.

Fine texture and water noise have the same size at this scale. On the mola, both have a median difference of 0.006 and a 75th percentile of 0.012. So no noise floor can tell them apart. The subject gate does that. The floor only drops the flattest pixels.

### Water calm (8 Oct 2026)

Correction lifts the noise in open water, and the sharpening steps lift it again. On IMG_7260 the far water has L* noise 0.88 in the source and 1.57 after correction. Open water has no detail to keep. So the water is smoothed before the colour stage, and it gets no light detail or fine detail.

- Kernels: `UnderBlueCalmShare`, `UnderBlueCalmSpread`, `UnderBlueCalmWeight`, `UnderBlueCalmPremultiply`, `UnderBlueWaterCalm`, `UnderBlueCalmKeep`. CPU mirrors: `FinishingMath.calmShare`, `calmFlatness`, `waterCalm`.
- The weight is the water share times the flatness. The water share is 1 - `neutralWeight`, the white reference's test.
- Flatness is the mean distance of the gamma luminance from its local mean (`calmWindowRadius`, 7/1200 of the short side). Only water pixels count, so a subject next to the water does not make the water look textured.
- Flatness is full below `calmFlatLow` (0.004) and off above `calmFlatHigh` (0.007). On O3 the water lies below 0.0045 (99th percentile) and the mola's spots above 0.0104 (5th percentile). A pale fish lit by blue water is water-coloured, but it is not flat, so it keeps its texture.
- Both inputs are the source, blurred by `calmBlurRadius` (3/1200), with the source's values. The restored path uses the same weight. Read on the restored image, the water share was 0.65 in far water and below 0.2 within 12 px of the turtle.
- Before the colour stage, a pixel moves toward a blur of water pixels only. So no subject colour spreads into the water.
- After the light detail and the fine detail, the weight takes the pixel back to its value before them.
- The unsharp masks still run on the water. Their dark fringe beside a subject is broad and soft. When it was removed from the open water only, its last few pixels became a sharp dark line along the subject (IMG_7261). Water noise is the same with or without them, because the water is already calm.
- The fine detail also takes the source's own subject test (the weight's blue channel), as the smaller of the two. On the restored image the water beside a bright subject tested as subject, and the layer drew a dark line there.
- 0.004 to 0.007 is a middle setting (Jake, 8 Oct 2026). The tuning run came before the unsharp masks were kept. There, the small bubbles in r10 kept 65% of their detail at 0.005 to 0.009, and 74% at 0.004 to 0.007. Lower settings keep more bubbles and leave more noise beside subjects. With the final code the bubbles keep 75% and O3's far seabed 90%.

| Measure, Mac harness at 1600 px | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| IMG_7260 far water, L* noise | 1.57 | 0.22 |
| IMG_7260 water 8 to 12 px from the turtle | 1.60 | 0.61 |
| IMG_7260 lightness 3 px from the turtle, against far water | -3.8 | -1.3 |
| O5 / O3 / r14 flat water noise (source flatness below 0.004) | 2.13 / 1.11 / 1.58 | 0.27 / 0.36 / 0.58 |
| O3 mola / belly texture | 6.47 / 6.97 | 6.39 / 6.92 |
| AquaColorFix gate, photo / video | 13.14 / 13.05 | 13.20 / 13.09 |

**Depth image clamp.** `RestorationEngine.depthImage` now clamps the depth map before scaling. Before, the border sampled the empty space outside the map. How much depended on the region that the later filters asked for. So any blur after the restoration changed the restored edge rows. With the water calm, `testRestoredVideoFrameKeepsItsEdges` read 0.948 on the iPhone, the simulator and the Mac. With the clamp it passes. The image interior is unchanged. The border now matches the old output.

### Highlight shoulder

Every finishing step can push a highlight past white, and none rolls it off. Before this rule, bright sand clipped in one channel and turned flat mint (r14). So the last finishing step is a shoulder: kernel `UnderBlueHighlightShoulder`, CPU mirror `FinishingMath.shoulder`.

- The peak is the largest channel in BT.709 / sRGB primaries (`FinishingMath.display`). The smallest output gamut clips first.
- The ceiling is 1, or the source pixel's own peak when that is higher. So HDR highlights keep their headroom. The restored path passes the unrestored source, so restoration cannot raise the ceiling.
- Below the knee (ceiling - 0.15) a pixel is unchanged.
- Above the knee the whole pixel is scaled, so its largest channel rolls off toward the ceiling. The hue stays.
- A pixel bright in every channel (smallest channel 0.65 to 0.9 of the ceiling), or 1.3 to 2 x over the ceiling, moves toward white at the same peak. Without this, the sun got a pink ring.

The pure white of an SDR image ends near 250 of 255 at intensity 0.8, because the shoulder never reaches the ceiling.

## Built-in presets

The UI gives each built-in preset only an intensity slider. Their values are in `DivePreset`.

| Preset | For | What it adds to the automatic result |
|---|---|---|
| Natural Dive | any water | Nothing. It is the automatic result and the base for Custom. |
| Tropical | shallow, bright water | `warmth` 600 K; more saturation (1.16) and vibrance (0.22) on subjects; more red (`restoration` 0.55) and clarity (0.19); `shadowBoost` 0.08; clear water moves to turquoise (`waterHue` 232), scaled down by deep, neon and hazy water |
| Deep Dive | deep, dark-blue water | More red (`restoration` 0.62); `shadowBoost` 0.20; `waterChroma` 0.78 calms neon water; more clarity (0.25) and cast removal (0.22) |

Natural values: `restoration` 0.45, `saturation` 1.08, `vibrance` 0.18, `clarity` 0.16, `castRemoval` 0.16, `contrast` 1.04. All presets share `contrast` 1.04.

- Preset values enter in several helpers: `restoration` in `SceneFactors`, `castRemoval` in `baseCastGains`, `saturation` in `presetSaturation`, `waterChroma` in `waterRules`, `contrast`, `clarity` and `vibrance` in `toneRules`.
- `presetRules` holds only the terms Natural and Custom never get: `warmth`, `shadowBoost` and the water saturation give-back. `make()` adds Custom's temperature after it.
- The extra saturation of a preset is meant for subjects. Water-like pixels give it back (`waterSaturation`), so the water keeps Natural's saturation.
- `waterChroma` scales the water tone's chroma ceiling. The water tone keeps the water's hue, so calmer water does not turn violet.
- Warmth is applied as light: the source is taken as lit at 6500 K + warmth and shown at 6500 K. A green tint of 1 per 100 K keeps the shift yellow, not orange.

## Custom preset

Custom is the user preset (gear tile). It starts from the Natural values and renders at full strength (`FilterSettings.customStrength` = 1), so it has no intensity slider. Five sliders change the automatic result. Each is a position from -1 to 1, shown as -100 to +100. `ColorCorrection.make` takes them as `adjustments`; every other preset ignores them.

| Slider | Value it changes | Change at -1 / +1 |
|---|---|---|
| Brightness | `midLift` down, `shadowLift` up | -0.25 / +0.075 |
| Contrast | `toneCurve` | -0.10 / +0.02 |
| Saturation | `saturation`; the water chroma ceiling ignores it, so the water shows it too | -0.45 / +0.35 x (1 - 0.6 x neon) |
| Clarity | `clarity` and `definition`, as a factor | x0 / x1.75 |
| Temperature | `warmth`; a cool shift gets no tint | -1500 K / +1500 K |

- The up moves of Brightness, Contrast and Saturation share one budget. When their sum is above 1, each is scaled down (`CustomAdjustments.budgeted`).
- The offsets enter before the guards and the white reference that read them. The highlight shoulder still runs last.
- Saturation does not move the water tone, the red gate or `subjectRed`. It acts at the `CIColorControls` step, on the water too: at +1 the water gains at most about a third more chroma.
- The caps are provisional (`CustomAdjustments.Caps`). Brightness, Contrast and Clarity were measured before the white reference and the highlight shoulder landed. Saturation and Temperature were widened on 25 Sep 2026 after an iPhone test, without a render measurement. See [Verification](Verification.md).
- One saved slot in UserDefaults (`customAdjustments.v1`) holds the five positions. The editor, batch and video share it.
- Custom gets no preset terms, so with every slider at 0 it equals Natural at full strength.

## Restoration kernel

The kernel is `UnderBlueRestoration` in `RestorationEngine.swift`. `RestorationMath` is its CPU mirror.

**Image formation:** `observed = clear x exp(-betaDirect x z) + backscatterInfinity x (1 - exp(-betaBackscatter x z))`, per channel (`RestorationMath.forward`).

The inverse removes the backscatter, then multiplies by `1 / transmission`.

It acts on a slightly blurred source (radius 0.0015 of the short side, at least 1.5 px). The source's fine detail (source minus blur) comes back times the pixel's own restoration ratio, restored blur / blur (kernel `UnderBlueRestoredDetail`). Without this, far water got about twice the noise per signal (IMG_7260): the veil removal takes signal, not noise, and the division scales both.

These limits apply. Most are in `RestorationLimits`; `channelRecoverability` is in the plan.

| Limit | Value or rule |
|---|---|
| `transmissionFloor` | 0.28 |
| `maximumGain` | Red 1.32 + 0.45 x red survival, green 1.55, blue 1.45, spread by cast (`WaterModelEstimator`) |
| Highlight protection | From peak 0.72 to 1.0, up to 80% of the source is kept |
| `maximumOutput` | 1.15; 8 for HDR video (`RestorationEngine.combined(_:moment:settings:filter:preservesHDR:)`) |
| `channelRecoverability` | Per-channel share of the correction that is applied |

Three hue rules run last:

- **`keepHueWhereDark`**: restoration can leave little light (channel sum ratio below 0.6). There the source hue is kept, at the restored level. So far water does not turn red-brown or violet.
- **`keepBlueFamily`**: a blue source pixel can turn green because the veil took its blue. If green/blue grew 4 to 8 times, the pixel keeps its source hue. This fixes a pale fish read at far-water depth on the video path.
- **`keepWarmRatio`**: a pale source pixel whose red already reaches green (`FinishingMath.uncast`) cannot get a higher red/green than its source. The red-first gain and the removal of a bluer veil raised it before. On the shark photo, restoration alone took the surface from 4.2% to 12.7% pink or violet pixels. With this rule it gives 3.2%.

The estimator spreads attenuation across channels only as far as the measured cast (`spread(_:by:)` with `castStrength`). A neutral scene gets equal attenuation, so greys stay grey. Plan confidence is the minimum of four values: the estimator's overall confidence (at most 0.9), depth, water-fit and temporal confidence (`RestorationPlan.init`).

## CPU mirrors and tests

The kernels run in Metal. The finishing kernels are in `FinishingKernels.metal`; their CPU mirrors are in `FinishingMath.swift`. The restoration kernels are in `RestorationKernels.metal`, and `RestorationMath` is in `RestorationEngine.swift`. Xcode compiles the `.metal` files into the app's `default.metallib`; `MetalKernels` loads them. The value rules are in `ColorCorrection.swift`: `make()`, its helpers (`SceneFactors`, `baseCastGains`, `presetSaturation`, `waterRules`, `toneRules`, `presetRules`) and the white reference. `ColorMath.swift` holds the colour spaces, the water target and solver, the restoration mirror and the lift curve. The CPU mirrors must give the same result:

| Kernel | CPU mirror | Test that compares them |
|---|---|---|
| `UnderBlueFinishColor` | `FinishingMath.color`, `waterLike`, `neutralWeight` | `testFinishingKernelMatchesCPUMirror`, `testFinishingKernelMatchesCPUMirrorWithWhiteReference` |
| `UnderBlueRestoration` | `RestorationMath.inverse` | `testRestorationKernelMatchesCPUMirror` |
| `UnderBlueDetail` | `FinishingMath.detail` | `testDetailKernelMatchesCPUMirror` |
| `UnderBlueHighlightShoulder` | `FinishingMath.shoulder` | `testHighlightShoulderKernelMatchesCPUMirror` |

`ColorCorrection.restoredMean` (in `ColorMath.swift`) also mirrors the restoration kernel on one colour, at the plan's mean depth or at a given depth. It skips highlight protection and the output clamp. It predicts the restored water and scene mean. Change it with the kernel.

Other guards in `UnderBlueTests/RestorationTests.swift`:

- `testNeutralScenesStayNeutralOnBothPaths`
- `testDarkFarWaterKeepsItsHue`, `testNearPaleFishAtFarDepthStaysBlueNotLime`, `testBlueFamilyGuardActsOnlyOnBluePixelsThatTurnGreen`
- `testWaterTargetNeverPointsTowardIndigoOrViolet`, `testVioletGuardKeepsBlueWaterFromTurningViolet`
- `testSimilarMurkyWaterColoursDoNotBecomeContrastingPatches`
- `testWaterAnalysisFieldListCoversEveryStoredValue`
- `testCyanCastSurfaceBecomesNearlyNeutral`, `testWhiteReferenceDoesNotNeutraliseTheWater`, `testSceneWithoutNeutralSurfacesIsUnchangedByTheWhiteReference`, `testNeutralRampStaysNeutralWithWhiteReferenceOnBothPaths`
- `testLargeBrightSubjectGetsLessLift`, `testBrightSubjectDarkensAHighlightScene`
- `testSubjectsLoseTheWaterLightButWaterAndGreyScenesDoNot`
- `testDetailLayerLandsOnSubjectsInTheBandOnly`
- `testSceneInliersKeepFramesWithAndWithoutANeutralSurface`, `testSceneMeanAveragesTheNeutralColourOnlyWhereItWasFound`
- `testHighlightShoulderStopsABrightPixelFromClippingAndKeepsItsHue`, `testHighlightShoulderLeavesPixelsBelowTheShoulderUnchanged`, `testHighlightShoulderTurnsATintedBlownHighlightWhite`, `testHighlightShoulderKeepsHDRHighlightsAboveWhite`, `testNeutralRampStaysNeutralThroughTheShoulderOnBothPaths`

Video averaging treats the white reference apart. `sceneInliers` judges frames by `sceneFields`, the water values only. A white surface or a bright subject comes and goes within one dive, so a frame without one is not odd. `sceneMean` takes the white surface colour only from frames that found one, weighted by `neutralShare`. `neutralShare` itself is the plain mean, so a surface seen in few frames counts for less.

A change to one kernel needs the same change in its mirror.

If the finishing kernel fails to compile, `FilterEngine.colorStage` falls back to a colour matrix: cast gains times white-reference gains, and a red rebuild at 0.3 of its value. There is no tone curve, water tone or subject light removal.

## How to evaluate a change

Use [scripts/color-eval](../scripts/color-eval/README.md). It compiles the app's own `Processing` sources.

deltaE is the mean CIE76 colour difference to the reference image. Lower is closer. UIEB is a public underwater image set with reference images. It was removed on 2 Oct 2026, so the UIEB figures below cannot be re-run.

1. Run `scripts/color-eval/aquacolorfix_eval.sh <name>` for the AquaColorFix gate (24 seconds). It prints the five pair ΔE values, the gate mean and the water hues. `HT_EVAL_LOG` shows every value `make()` produced and a probe of the water, neutral and mean colours through the chain.
2. Run `scripts/color-eval/tune_eval.sh <name>`.
3. Check the guards in the harness README. They cover the neutral ramp, real photos, market pairs, neutral surfaces and the AquaColorFix gate.
4. Open the sheets and look at them. The numbers do not show everything.

Water hue uses OKLab. CIELAB hue cannot separate azure (273), pure blue (306) and violet (310). So earlier "violet water" counts, including one commit message, mixed blue with violet. The bands are cyan 180 to 235, blue 235 to 270, indigo 270 to 282, violet 282 and above.

## Current scorecard

Three code states appear below:

- "Before" is `c411a2e`, before the AquaColorFix tuning.
- "Tuning" is the first AquaColorFix tuning commit of 28 Sep 2026 (`4fa62e3`).
- "HEAD" is `b4594ab`, measured on 28 Sep 2026 in the evening. Since the tuning commit it added:
  - the fine detail layer and per-scene video values
  - the softer tone and luminance-only sharpening
  - the violet-band and green-cast fixes, and the veil offset
  - the restoration detail split and the depth blend

Only the gate, the market pairs and the UIEB holdout were re-measured at HEAD. Every other figure in this section is from the tuning commit or older.

**AquaColorFix gate** (five private triplets; see [the benchmark](AquaColorFixBenchmark.md)), mean deltaE to the AquaColorFix output:

| Set | Before | Tuning | HEAD |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gate pairs 2, 4, 5, photo path | 20.70 | 12.50 | 12.31 |
| Gate pairs 2, 4, 5, video path | unmeasured | unmeasured | 12.85 |
| All five pairs, photo path | 16.85 | 11.18 | 10.59 |
| All five pairs, video path | 17.26 | 11.81 | 11.23 |

HEAD per pair, photo path: p1 7.40, p2 14.18, p3 8.60, p4 9.94, p5 12.82. Water hue (OKLab, ours / AquaColorFix): 238/240, 262/263, 239/242, 236/239, 248/240.

**Market pairs** (m1-m6: private before/after pairs the product owner chose as the target look; see the harness README), deltaE to the market "after", full resolution:

| Pair | Original | Before | Tuning | HEAD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| m1 | 34.0 | 23.1 | 23.1 | 23.0 |
| m2 | 32.7 | 15.3 | 23.7 | 23.9 |
| m3 | 17.5 | 22.0 | 22.4 | 22.1 |
| m4 | 25.0 | 18.3 | 20.1 | 17.5 |
| m5 | 39.0 | 29.1 | 28.0 | 18.4 |
| m6 | 33.9 | 25.2 | 22.9 | 22.4 |

m2 got worse at the tuning commit and stays there. Two causes were measured:

- Its mid-tones are darker than its target: mean L* 31 against 42.
- m2 is green water (`waterType` 0.95). The water tone moves it to azure 240 in full. The water solver sits at both bounds (blue gain 2.2, chroma scale 1.6). Red is 0 on 70% of the pixels; the target has 10% (harness at 960 px).

The AquaColorFix look keeps a dark scene dark, the m2 target lifts it. This is a product decision; see [Verification](Verification.md). m3 is a mood grade and needs a preset.

**UIEB dev, 40 images** (tuning commit; unmeasured at HEAD): deltaE 19.20 (before 19.35; 24.16 before the 25 Sep 2026 changes). Video path 18.87 (before 18.95). The original images score 24.51. Indigo or violet water: 0. Green water left: 1 of 6. Beats the original on 82% (before 85%). The best images improved (576: 11.0 to 10.2; 433: 19.5 to 18.2); 108 got worse (21.0 to 23.6, a bright scene we now darken).

**UIEB holdout, 40 images:**

| Version | deltaE |
|---|---|
| Original image | 22.96 |
| `f548c29` | 20.00 |
| `f9b073d` | 20.60 |
| `b8db6df` | 21.01 |
| `6fd84cf` | 20.12 |
| Tuning (`4fa62e3`) | unmeasured |
| HEAD (`b4594ab`), photo path | 20.44 |
| HEAD (`b4594ab`), video path (`uniform`) | 20.44 |

Holdout deltaE rose from 20.00 at `f548c29` to 21.01 at `b8db6df`. The market direction moved away from UIEB's muted references. The white reference brought it back to 20.12.

At HEAD it is 20.44. Over the same work the AquaColorFix gate fell from 20.70 to 12.31. So the gate gains are specific to the AquaColorFix look; they do not carry over to UIEB. HEAD beats the original on 28 of 40 holdout images (70%).

HEAD holdout, green-water sources (original far hue below 180, CIELAB), 6 images:

| Variant | Still green | deltaE |
|---|---|---|
| UIEB reference | 6 | – |
| Original | 5 | 33.47 |
| Grey world | 0 | 21.22 |
| HEAD photo path | 1 | 27.44 |

The references keep green water green. HEAD keeps 1 green, makes 3 cyan, 1 neutral and 1 at CIELAB hue 265 or above. A plain grey-world balance scores 6 deltaE better on these images.

HEAD holdout plan confidence: min 0.589, p10 0.623, median 0.664, p90 0.683, max 0.688. Depth confidence: 0.666 to 0.695. So `physicalWeight` is about 0.66 on every image.

**Real dive photos, 15, no reference:** none is pushed into indigo or violet. r04's anemone is really magenta (295 in the original, 300 now). Before the 25 Sep 2026 changes, 12 were.

**Neutral grey ramp:** max Lab chroma 0.01 on both paths (before: 0.97 on the video path, the harness's `uniform` stand-in).

**Neutral surfaces**, OKLab chroma (0 = colourless), before and after the tuning commit (unmeasured at HEAD):

| Surface | Original | Photo path, before | Photo path, tuning | Video path, before | Video path, tuning | Sea-thru |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| m5 sand | 0.109 | 0.032 | 0.036 | 0.014 | 0.033 | 0.004 |
| m5 chart, grey row | 0.132 | 0.034 | 0.063 | 0.046 | 0.057 | 0.079 |
| m6 manta belly | 0.111 | 0.026 | 0.029 | 0.033 | 0.046 | 0.063 |

The chroma rose on all three, most on the chart. The residual changed side. Before it was cyan (hue 184 to 217). At the tuning commit it is green-yellow (126 to 173), because the light removal takes more blue than green. The harness guard "neutral surfaces do not rise" is not met by this change; the AquaColorFix bright-neutral chroma fell from 0.065 to 0.043.

## Decision record

### Adopted

No separate figure is recorded here for these four. The scorecard shows the combined result.

- Scene water colour and a continuous `waterType`. Teal counts as green through red loss.
- OKLab water tone.
- Red rebuild gated relative to the water, with `redCeiling` and `violetGuard`.
- Scene-key contrast and brightness. `tonePivot`, `toneCurve` and `midLift` read the scene median.

| Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Attenuation spread scaled by cast | Neutral ramp max chroma: 7.7 before, 0.01 now |
| `keepHueWhereDark` and `keepBlueFamily` | A lime fish on the video path: green/blue 1.45 before, 0.86 now |
| Pale surface light: `FinishingMath.uncast` and `keepWarmRatio` (3 Oct 2026) | Shark surface pink or violet pixels 28.5% to 11.3% (source 4.2%). Caustics on sand, cave rays and cave floor unchanged. AquaColorFix gate 10.98 to 10.98. Market m1 24.1 to 24.0, m3 20.7 to 21.0 (a mood grade). r04 keeps its magenta anemone. |
| Chroma-confidence fade for murky water (`b8db6df`) | Visibly fewer block patches on a compressed murky image |
| Confidence coverage fix (`candidateCoverage` over 8 x 256 samples) | Plan confidence was capped near 0.41 on all 890 UIEB images. The median is now about 0.66. |
| White reference (`neutralGains`) and highlight rule, measured together | Photo path chroma: m5 sand 0.076 to 0.032, m6 belly 0.069 to 0.026. m6 mean L* 54.6 to 48.6. Holdout deltaE 21.01 to 20.12. |
| Video outlier test on water values only | Unit test data: sand in 7 of 10 frames. The old test dropped the 3 frames without sand. It also dropped 1 frame with a bright subject. |
| Subject light removal (`subjectTone`) | AquaColorFix gate 20.70 to 15.41 with the azure goal and the wider bounds; pair 2 (lavender fish) 30.5 to 17.2. Green capped at 1 and the "never below red" clamp: silver fish chroma 0.047 to 0.017, gate 15.40 to 13.60. |
| Trusted blue reference, pale-only gate, cool-only gains | Pair 3 13.2 to 9.6 (the mola is the candidate); grey ramp on the restored path stays 0.01 (a warm restored grey got gains of one). |
| Water hue goal 240 in full, bounds 0.35 to 2.2, solver polish | Water hue on pairs 1 and 5: 246 and 257 to 238 and 247 (target 240). The polish took pair 5 from 16.2 to 13.9. |
| Murky chroma floor 0.14 to 0.22 | Pair 2 water chroma 0.17 to 0.20 (AquaColorFix 0.23). |
| Tone: shadow lift 0.28 + 0.22 haze to 0.2 + 0.15 haze; highlights 0.92 - 0.2 haze; highlight rule down to -0.12 | Gate 13.60 to 12.50; median L* on pairs 1 to 3 within 2 of AquaColorFix (before +3 to +7). Shadows kept the black level: brightness stayed at exposure x 0.45. |
| Water calm and depth image clamp (8 Oct 2026) | See [Water calm](#water-calm-8-oct-2026). Far water noise on IMG_7260 1.57 to 0.22; mola texture 6.47 to 6.39; gate 13.14 to 13.20. |
| Fine detail layer, strength 1.3, floor 0.004, band to 0.15 to 0.30, gated by the neutral weight | Pair 3 detail energy 5.07 to 6.79 (AquaColorFix 8.10); subject detail up on every pair; water detail on pair 3 stays under AquaColorFix's (5.59 against 6.52). Gate 12.50 to 12.54. No visible halo on the mola or the manta edge at 100%. |

### Rejected

| Idea | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Jerlov coefficient priors | No measurable gain. They are copied tables. |
| Clear-water veil in the style of UWCNN | deltaE 26.1 against a 24.2 baseline, 40 images |
| Per-pixel depth for video, including optical-flow depth warping | On photos, per-pixel depth was not better than constant depth. Per-pixel minus constant: +0.54 deltaE on dev, +0.25 on holdout, at that time. At HEAD (`b4594ab`) photos keep per-pixel depth. It beats constant depth on the AquaColorFix pairs (10.59 against 11.23). It also wins on 5 of 6 market pairs; m1 is the exception (23.0 against 20.6). On the holdout they tie (20.44). |
| A finer water-fit beta grid (0.05 to 0.01) | deltaE changed by 0.03 |
| A fixed recipe, for example a +36 magenta tint | It pushes blue water violet. The rules adapt to the measured cast instead. |
| The highlight rule without its dark-scene and contrast fades | UIEB 12324 mean L* fell from 32.2 to 16.3 |
| Warmth from 6500 K to 6500 K + warmth (used until `13ffbee`) | It cooled the image: at +300 K, grey 0.40 became (0.391, 0.401, 0.417). Tropical was cooler than Natural, and its grey ramp chroma was 4.00 (photo) and 4.87 (video), over the limit of 3. |
| Deep Dive calming by scaling `waterSaturation` | It turned 42% of r02's pixels indigo or violet (Natural: 7%). Tried again on 29 Sep 2026, scaled by neon only: still r02 +36 and r11 +27 points of violet pixels. |
| Tropical brightness offset +0.012 (colorControls, 29 Sep 2026) | It turned dark blue water indigo: r05 violet pixels 9.9% (Natural) to 15.6%, m2 +3.7 and r12 +2.9 points. Tropical gets `shadowBoost` 0.08 instead. |
| Deep Dive water hue goal 252 (bluer) and `restoration` 0.70 (29 Sep 2026) | Each added violet pixels (OKLab hue 270 to 330, chroma 0.03 or more) on r02 and r11; together with the saturation scaling r02 reached 39% (Natural 3%). |
| Per-pixel OKLab hue pull of water-like pixels toward 240 (28 Sep 2026) | Gate 15.40 to 20.66. It fights the white reference, whose candidates are water-like, and keeps chroma the gains had removed. |
| Restored-path lift cap 0.5 for the pair 2 fish | Pair 2 17.2 to 19.1: the water went too dark. |
| Brightness (the black level) 0.45 to 0.3, or 0 | Shadows 8 to 10 L* below AquaColorFix on pairs 3 and 5; at 0 the shadows collapsed to L* 3. |
| Murky lift goal 1.2 + 0.9 murky^2 to 1.1 + 0.4 murky^2 | No change on pair 2 (its lift is capped either way); market m2 lost 8 deltaE. |
| Old shadow lift kept with the rest of the tone change | m2 23.7 to 23.1 only; gate 12.50 to 13.02. |
| Detail layer gated by the plain water-like weight, floor 0.012 | Pair 3 detail 5.07 to 5.19: the mola is water-like, so it got nothing. |
| Water calm weight from colour alone (8 Oct 2026) | It blurred the O3 mola and the O4 manta and its reef: both are water-coloured. |
| Water calm weight read on the restored image | Its water share was 0.65 in far water and below 0.2 within 12 px of a subject. That left a band of noise around the IMG_7260 turtle, about 60 px wide. |
| Water calm also taking back the unsharp masks | It turned their soft dark fringe into a sharp dark line along the IMG_7261 wrasse. |
| Detail strength 1.6, or radius 2.0/480 | Pair 3 reached 7.19, but the gate rose to 12.57 to 12.65 and pair 4 went past AquaColorFix (9.1 against 7.7). |

## Comparison with AquaColorFix

AquaColorFix is a competing app whose look the product owner prefers. [The benchmark](AquaColorFixBenchmark.md) compares five triplets and drove the 28 Sep 2026 tuning. Its main findings:

- A global colour mapping explains most of AquaColorFix's output.
- It lowers blue on every subject. Its neutrals are grey or warm, never cyan.
- Its water sits near azure.
- It is about 4 L* darker, with less broad contrast and more sharpening.

Its stronger sharpening was taken in part, as the [fine detail layer](#clarity) (`07c004d`). No depth change was taken.

## Comparison with Sea-thru

Sea-thru (Akkaynak and Treibitz, CVPR 2019) uses the same kind of image-formation model as our restoration kernel. Its results are much cleaner, because its inputs are different:

- It uses RAW images, not camera-processed JPEGs.
- It uses measured distance. The distance map comes from several overlapping photos and photogrammetry.
- It re-balances white after removing the veil, so sand and grey surfaces become neutral.

We measured two Sea-thru results (market pairs m5 and m6) with the harness. The "ours" columns show `b8db6df`, then `6fd84cf`:

| Measure | m5 original | m5 ours | m5 Sea-thru | m6 original | m6 ours | m6 Sea-thru |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| deltaE to the Sea-thru result | 39.0 | 33.1 → 29.1 | (reference) | 33.9 | 29.5 → 25.3 | (reference) |
| Mean L* | 60.1 | 57.9 → 58.3 | 36.4 | 52.9 | 54.6 → 48.6 | 38.7 |
| Subject red/green (`nearRG`) | 0.37 | 0.66 → 0.87 | 1.04 | 0.35 | 0.70 → 0.81 | 0.91 |
| Neutral surface, OKLab chroma | sand 0.109 | 0.076 → 0.032 | 0.004 | belly 0.111 | 0.069 → 0.026 | 0.063 |

What we took, as our own rules:

- A white reference after veil removal (see [White reference](#white-reference)).
- Brightness that respects bright subjects: the highlight rule. The manta belly no longer makes the whole frame brighter.
- Neutral surfaces as a scorecard check (the harness "Neutral surfaces" section).

What we cannot take into a one-photo app:

- Measured distance. It needs several overlapping photos and photogrammetry.
- Distance-dependent attenuation. It only helps with measured distance.
- RAW input would help the photo path. It is possible later; its gain is unmeasured.

## Known limits and next steps

- The water calm smooths small bubbles and low-contrast far texture that are as flat as water noise. r10's bubbles keep 75% of their detail and O3's far seabed 90% (8 Oct 2026). A dark fringe of 1 to 3 px stays beside bright subjects; it comes from the unsharp masks.
- A diver's hand in teal water stays grey-green. Its red is about 10/255, and it is green-family.
- Near subjects on the constant-depth video path go darker and greener. `keepBlueFamily` covers only blue-family pixels.
- On an iPhone 17 (iOS 27.0), both kernel/CPU-mirror tests and the two device-only depth tests pass (4 test suites, 65 tests, 0 failures). One depth inference took 22 ms. Full video export speed on an iPhone is unmeasured.
- Mood grades like m3 are out of scope for automatic correction.
- m5 still differs from Sea-thru after the 29 Sep reference-adaptation change. At 640 px the latest
  scorecard reports mean L* 38.7 against 36.4; at the source-resolution PNG evaluation the whole-image
  CIE76 improved from 19.71 to 17.25. Do not compare those values across harness resolutions.
- On m6 the reef under the manta is olive-green (photo path) or yellow-green (video path). On Sea-thru it is brown.
- The detail layer has one strength for every scene. Pairs 1 and 4 now carry more fine-detail energy than AquaColorFix (9.4 and 8.6 against 6.7 and 7.7): their sources are busier. A source-detail measurement in the analysis could set the strength per scene; it is not built.
- Against AquaColorFix: pair 2's fish keeps a faint green-yellow tint (chroma about 0.02) and is about 10 L* brighter. The darker half of pair 4's manta keeps some mint. Pair 5's fish school is pale cyan where AquaColorFix has it warm. Pairs 4 and 5 stay 4 to 6 L* brighter in the mid-tones.
- The m5 chart and sand improved overall, but individual bright chart patches still regress. The
  source-resolution panel result and its limitations are in [the m5 evaluation](M5ColorEvaluation.md).
- Market m2 is darker than its target since the 28 Sep 2026 tuning.
- The white reference on real video is unmeasured. The harness has no video; only unit tests cover the averaging.
- The highlight shoulder on HDR export is unmeasured. It reads its peak in BT.709, so saturated Display P3 colours are held a little lower than P3 needs.
- On the video path r14's sand stays mint-green. The restoration kernel's own limit flattens that colour before finishing.
- The white reference trusts a strongly blue candidate. Pale water near the surface can be that candidate. The open water is protected by `neutralWeight`. A bright patch of water of another colour would be neutralised with the subjects.
- Preset distance from Natural (29 Sep 2026, 26 images: r01-r15, O1-O5, m1-m6, median CIE76 over the image): Tropical 4.0 to 5.4, Deep Dive 3.2 to 5.2. The largest gain in violet pixels over Natural is 0.1 points (Tropical) and 0.8 points (Deep Dive). Deep Dive still barely calms neon water: every way to calm it that was tried made violet.
- Deep Dive turns some of r11's sea fans lavender: 12.1% of pixels have OKLab hue 270 to 330 and chroma 0.03 or more (Natural: 2.7%). The far-water check does not see it.
- Tropical moves some cyan or green water a little greener (m1 water hue 216 to 212, m2 240 to 225). In r10 it gives the sun core a light peach tint.
- The particle filter and temporal denoiser are prototypes in `Prototypes/VideoCleanup`. They are not wired in.

## Open problems and next tasks

Status reviewed on 29 Sep 2026. Historical measurements below name their original date/commit;
current m5 and wider reference results are in [M5ColorEvaluation.md](M5ColorEvaluation.md) and
[AdditionalReferenceReview.md](AdditionalReferenceReview.md).

### Reported by the product owner

The product owner still sees these four problems by eye on current outputs (28 Sep 2026). No harness metric shows them yet, so the gate cannot see them either.

| Symptom | Related measurements so far | At HEAD |
|---|---|---|
| Green cast is made stronger | Neutral-surface residual turned green-yellow (hue 126 to 173) at the tuning commit. m6 reef under the manta is olive-green. Sea-thru 03–05 and 07–08 still retain cyan/green subjects. | visible in the additional reference review; no subject-mask gate yet |
| Violet appears | Deep Dive turns 12.1% of r11's pixels lavender. The violet band near the sun (IMG_7287) was fixed in `29f677d`. | unmeasured; the images are not collected yet |
| Colours are flat: everything comes out beige | On 8682 the target has 9.6% warm pixels, ours had 0% (28 Sep 2026, at `c092902`). Aqua 02 and 05 and Sea-thru 03 still lack warm subject colours. | visible and paired; no general warm-subject metric yet |
| Strong noise | O3 colour noise after luminance-only sharpening: flat water 1.28 against AquaColorFix 0.96, fish 3.29 against 1.81. The 29 Sep adapted contribution now denoises before its channel gains; other contributions do not. | m5 flat-region proxy measured; O3 and general pipeline still unresolved |

### Found in the 28 Sep 2026 review

All measured at HEAD. The numbers are in the [scorecard](#current-scorecard) and in [Tone and brightness](#tone-and-brightness).

1. **Green water is forced to azure.** The hue goal 240 acts in full, whatever `waterType` is. The references keep green water green; we keep 1 of 6. On m2 the water solver sits at both bounds and red is 0 on 70% of the pixels. The gate pairs are blue water (`waterType` 0 on four, 0.57 on pair 4), so the gate never tests this.
2. **The gate is also the tuning set.** The gate fell from 20.70 to 12.31 while the UIEB holdout moved from 20.12 to 20.44. No independent set checks the product look.
3. **Plan confidence is nearly flat.** It is 0.62 to 0.68 on 80% of the holdout. So "a low-confidence fit gives `current`" almost never acts.
4. **`contrast` and `brightness` are a linear gain and a black offset.** Their names do not say so, and two filters nearly cancel each other on dark scenes.
5. **The luminance weights do not match the working space.** `ColorCorrection.luma`, `FilterEngine.analyze`, the finishing kernels and `WaterModelEstimator` use BT.709 weights (0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722). The working space is linear Rec. 2020, whose weights are (0.2627, 0.6780, 0.0593). `lab`, `oklab` and `PhotoHDR` use the Rec. 2020 weights. On the pair 1 water colour the difference is about 6%; red is under-weighted by 19%.
6. **Most sharpening inputs still have no noise removal.** The 29 Sep bright-scene adapted
   contribution denoises before its channel gains, but this is not a general pre-colour or temporal
   denoiser. The product-order problem remains for the rest of the pipeline.
7. **The veil offset rests on one image.** Its evidence is m5 alone. Only gate pair 4 has a median luminance of 0.2 or more (0.21), and it is teal (`waterType` 0.57), so its offset is tiny. The code comment says "median 0.2 to 0.3", but the full offset also applies above 0.3.

### Tasks, in order

1. **Make each reported symptom measurable.**
   - Partial on 29 Sep: m5 now has source-resolution PNG regions for its 18 panel patches, sand,
     coral and water, plus black-share and high-pass colour-residual proxies. Sea-thru 8 pairs and
     AquaColorFix 5 pairs were reviewed. This does not yet provide the four general subject masks
     and metrics below, so the task remains open.
   - Collect the images that show each symptom from the product owner. Keep them in `DeveloperMedia/`, never under `UnderBlueTests/`.
   - Add one number per symptom to `aquacolorfix_eval.sh`:
     - green cast: share of subject pixels (not water-like) with OKLab hue 110 to 170 and chroma 0.03 or more
     - violet: share of pixels with OKLab hue 282 to 330 and chroma 0.03 or more
     - flat and beige: subject chroma (75th percentile) and the share of warm pixels (OKLab hue 20 to 90), against the source and AquaColorFix
     - noise: colour noise in flat patches, measured on PNG output, not on the harness's q0.85 JPEG
   - Done when each symptom shows as a number on its own images.
2. **Find the step behind each symptom.** Follow one pixel per symptom through the chain with the `HT_EVAL_LOG` probe: cast gains, subject light removal, white reference, water tone, red rebuild, `CIColorControls`, shadow lift, sharpening, detail layer. Start with these two ideas. Neither is measured yet:
   - beige: subject light removal, the white reference and "green and blue never fall below red" together pull every subject toward a grey-warm colour
   - green: the light removal takes more blue than green
3. **Green water.** Scale the hue move by `waterType`, so green water keeps more of its own hue. Check m2, the 6 green-water holdout images and the gate.
4. **Noise.** Put a noise step before the colour correction (the denoiser prototype in `Prototypes/VideoCleanup`). Or lower the unsharp masks and the detail layer where the source is noisy. Measure on O3 and IMG_7260, on PNG.
5. **Confidence.** Make plan and depth confidence follow the real fit quality. Or state that the weight is a fixed 0.66.
6. **Explainable tone values.** Replace `CIColorControls` contrast and brightness with a named gain and a named black offset. Move `luma` to the Rec. 2020 weights. Both need a retune, so do them after tasks 1 to 4.
7. **A second look set.** Add images that no tuning step used, scored against the product look, as a holdout for the gate.
   - Partial on 29 Sep: UIEB holdout:40 was run after freezing the candidate, and the separate
     Sea-thru set exposed weak generalization. Sea-thru needs registration and caption/border masks
     before it can become a quantitative gate; duplicated scenes must not be counted independently.
8. **Carried over.** Particle removal before colour correction; deblur after it. Measure the full video export speed on an iPhone once the algorithm is done.
