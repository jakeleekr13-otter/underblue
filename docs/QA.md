# QA matrix

Status reflects automated tests in this repository, except where a row says it was checked by hand. “Device QA” is deliberately not marked complete without physical media/hardware.

| Area | Coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Photo formats | JPEG portrait orientation; generated HEIC; Display P3 output; preview/export pixel comparison; portrait Sony RAW at full size; JPEG output with full-resolution colour (4:4:4); 10-bit HEIC output with the same colour and capture date | Automated pass on simulator and iPhone 17 (RAW needs the DeveloperMedia sample) |
| HDR photos | Gain-map JPEG and HEIC output; headroom kept; SDR image equals the SDR export; SDR sources stay SDR | Automated pass on iPhone 17; the end-to-end test skips on the simulator |
| Import and names | Files type list; share inbox order and cleanup; saved file names | Automated pass |
| Share sheet | Extension UI, activation limits (10 photos or 1 video), Live Photo as a still | Device QA required |
| Filter behavior | Original/0%, 50%, 100%; neutral black/white; red restoration | Automated pass |
| SDR codecs | H.264 and HEVC | Automated pass |
| Resolution | 1080p; generated 4K; no upscaling; portrait dimensions | Automated pass |
| Timing | 24/30/60 fps; variable presentation timestamps; 10-second trial boundary | Automated pass |
| Audio | AAC audio present and absent; audio track count and duration | Automated pass |
| Orientation | Portrait metadata is baked; output transform is identity; source/output pixels compared | Automated pass |
| Cancellation | Before start and during export; no partial output remains | Automated pass |
| Long export | Two-minute 3,600-frame sequential export; bounded post-warmup memory after output-pool cap | Automated pass |
| Video V2 logic | Device/source policy separation; thermal analysis degradation; per-channel confidence; persistent environment reset; false-reset suppression; timestamp plan lookup; stale preview rejection | Automated pass |
| HDR input/output | HLG and PQ 10-bit detection; HDR→SDR; HLG/PQ Main10 signaling; highlight values above SDR white | Automated pass on simulator codecs |
| Dolby Vision | No output claim; base HDR compatibility only | Device QA required |
| Trial | 3 photos, then 1 photo every 24 hours; 1 video every 24 hours; 10 seconds; clock set back or forward; 1.1.9 Keychain value migrates; rollback after failure/interruption; real Keychain round trip (`TrialTests`) | Automated pass |
| Watermark | Free photo and every free video frame carry the mark in the bottom-right corner; other pixels unchanged; only free exports set the mark (`WatermarkTests`); a Pro batch photo has no mark, a free one has it (`BatchEngineTests`, Mac) | Automated pass |
| StoreKit | Real App Store sandbox: buy; Restore Purchase; Pro returns after delete and reinstall without Restore Purchase | Sandbox pass by hand (Jake, 29 Sep 2026). `PurchaseTests` are not run, by decision (29 Sep 2026) |
| Localization | English source/fallback; Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese; localized errors and Photos usage string | Automated bundle pass |
| Diagnostics | Failure classification, nested errors, bounded retry, privacy sanitization, burst aggregation and report size | Automated pass |
| UI | Home, paywall, Photos picker, photo editor, compare, export sheet, save and the second free photo; landscape video editor | Simulator UI test |

## Physical-device release matrix

Run these before an App Store release:

- JPEG, HEIC and Adaptive HDR photos from current iPhones; verify actual Photos metadata and wide-color rendering. Save one HDR photo as HDR and as SDR, and compare both in Photos.
- Camera RAW: iPhone ProRAW DNG and one other camera (ARW, CR3 or NEF). Check full resolution, preview speed and memory.
- Share sheet from Photos and from Files, and Import from Files with an iCloud Drive file that is not downloaded yet. Check the saved file names in Photos.
- GoPro, DJI Osmo Action and Insta360 samples: H.264/HEVC, 8/10-bit, 1080p/4K, 30/60 fps, portrait/landscape, variable timing, with/without audio.
- iPhone HLG/Dolby Vision, external-camera HLG/HDR10 and unusual compatible Dolby Vision clips. Inspect every result in Photos, QuickTime/AVAsset and a metadata tool. Confirm UnderBlue never labels output Dolby Vision.
- Multi-minute and long 4K exports on the oldest supported iPhone. Measure peak memory, thermal behavior, sustained frame rate and free-space estimates with Instruments.
- Run the dedicated [Video V2 real-world matrix](VideoV2QA.md); specifically inspect temporal color pumping, depth-map popping and environment transitions.
- Background, lock, phone call, memory warning, thermal critical, disk-full and Photos permission-denied flows. Confirm cleanup and trial rollback.
- VoiceOver, Dynamic Type accessibility sizes, landscape layout, long Japanese/Chinese strings and every supported language in pseudolocalization.
- Real App Store sandbox: not purchased, cancel, Ask to Buy/pending, interrupted transaction, refund/revocation and offline StoreKit. Buy, restore and reinstall passed on 29 Sep 2026.
- TestFlight crash/hang: detach the debugger, reproduce, confirm symbolication in Xcode Organizer and inspect the user-shared local diagnostic report.
