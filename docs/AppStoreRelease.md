# App Store release checklist

Last reviewed: 2026-10-31

## Current release: iPhone 1.1.8 (build 14), 31 Oct 2026

iPhone only. The Mac targets stay at 1.0 (1).

- 1.1.7 (13) was uploaded on 27 Oct 2026. Its release note is in `AppStoreMetadata.md`.
- 1.1.8 (14) is archived, not uploaded (31 Oct 2026). New since 1.1.7:
  - Video: each scene fits its reef colour to the photo rule, so an olive reef turns brown.
  - The restored path no longer takes the cast off twice. Green-teal water stayed grey-white before.
  - SDR video export matches the preview. It was brighter before.
  - The video preview shows the original until the analysis is done.
  - A video export pauses in the background. It goes on when the app is back before iOS suspends it.
  - A rating prompt from the 10th save, once per version, only online.
- Release note: `AppStoreMetadata.md`, "What's New (1.1.8)" (Jake approved the English text, 31 Oct 2026).
- Checks and open device checks: `Verification.md`, 29 to 31 Oct 2026.
- Known test failure: the JPEG colour resolution test fails on the simulator, also before these changes (`Verification.md`, 31 Oct).
- Not fixed: the first 2 s of the napoleon clip stay pink (`Roadmap.md` 3.5).

## iPhone 1.1.4 (build 10), 23 Oct 2026 (history)

iPhone only. The Mac targets stay at 1.0 (1) and were not checked for this build.

New since 1.1.3: the camera JPEG reef colour, and the Icon Composer app icon (`IconComposer.md`,
step 3). The video work of 22 Oct 2026 shipped in 1.1.3. The subject picker and subject emphasis are
not in it; they live on branch `subject-picker`.

Release note: "More natural reef colours in JPEG photos." It does not mention the new icon.

Checks run for it are in `Verification.md`, "Camera JPEG reef colour".

Store page work for 1.1.4 (23 Oct 2026). Jake submitted the app the same day.

- New app icon: `UnderBlue/Resources/AppIcon.icon` (Icon Composer), in build 10. See `docs/IconComposer.md`.
- Product page header: `AppStoreAssets/Screenshots/header/universal-5244x2950.png`, uploaded by Jake.
- Search results (same file), Korean metadata (`docs/AppStoreMetadata.md`) and Korean screenshots (`AppStoreAssets/Screenshots/ko/final`): prepared. The Korean app information was already in App Store Connect before 1.1.5 (Jake, 24 Oct 2026); the screenshot upload is not recorded.
- Product Page Optimization: not used (Jake, 23 Oct 2026).

## Release decision for 1.0 (history, 29 Sep 2026)

The current source colour pipeline changed after the last App Store Connect archive and screenshot capture.
Do not submit the existing archive or the old `final-v2` screenshots as the final 1.0 assets.
The change improves the m5 photo and its colour panel, but it does not yet pass every colour-quality
criterion: several individual panel patches and evaluation images regress, Sea-thru subjects remain
too cyan/bright, and the constant-depth video proxy still has sand/noise and shadow regressions.

Evidence and scope are recorded in [the m5 evaluation](M5ColorEvaluation.md) and
[the additional Sea-thru/AquaColorFix review](AdditionalReferenceReview.md). Before release, either:

1. accept these documented limits as the 1.0 colour behavior, rerun the physical-device matrix and
   capture a fresh archive and screenshots from exactly that source; or
2. continue colour work, then repeat the same evaluation and release checks.

An App Store Connect form being complete does not override this local release gate.

## Xcode configuration

- Product: `UnderBlue`
- Bundle ID: `com.underblue.app`
- Version: `1.0`
- Build: `1`
- Minimum OS: iOS 26.0
- Signing: Automatic, team `M3HJ7YK7N7`
- Share extension: `UnderBlueShare`, bundle ID `com.underblue.app.share`, embedded in the app
- App Group: `group.com.underblue.app`, in both the app and the extension entitlements. Automatic signing registered both on 28 Sep 2026. The old App Store profile has no App Group, so the next archive creates a new one.
- App icon: 1024×1024 PNG without alpha
- Release debug information: DWARF with dSYM
- Release validation, whole-module optimization and dead-code stripping: enabled
- Non-exempt encryption: `NO` (the app contains no proprietary encryption)
- App category in the generated Info.plist: `public.app-category.photography`

All four targets—`UnderBlue`, `UnderBlueShare`, `UnderBlueTests` and `UnderBlueUITests`—are explicitly limited to:

- Supported platforms: `iphoneos iphonesimulator`
- Targeted device family: iPhone (`1`)
- Mac Catalyst: disabled
- Designed for iPhone/iPad on Mac: disabled
- Designed for iPhone/iPad on Apple Vision: disabled

The latest device build was verified with `UIDeviceFamily = [1]`, `CFBundleSupportedPlatforms = ["iPhoneOS"]` and `LSRequiresIPhoneOS = true`. Xcode may still list iPad simulators as run destinations because iPhone-only apps can run in iPadOS compatibility mode. This does not enable native iPad support and does not require iPad screenshots.

The add-only Photos usage description is localised through `InfoPlist.xcstrings`. The privacy manifest declares no tracking and lists required-reason API usage for disk space, file timestamps and app-only UserDefaults. The share extension calls none of the required-reason APIs; its code was checked on 28 Sep 2026. So it has no privacy manifest of its own. UnderBlue has no automatic analytics or diagnostic upload.

## Public support and privacy pages

- Support URL: <https://jakeleekr13-otter.github.io/underblue-support/support/>
- Privacy Policy URL: <https://jakeleekr13-otter.github.io/underblue-support/privacy/>
- Public website repository: <https://github.com/jakeleekr13-otter/underblue-support>
- Support email: `support@enheart.me`
- Privacy email: `privacy@enheart.me`

## Website and Google Search Console (28 Oct 2026)

- Landing page: <https://jakeleekr13-otter.github.io/underblue-support/>. It can be the Marketing URL in App Store Connect. Whether that field is set was not checked.
- Languages: English at the root, then `/ko/`, `/ja/`, `/zh-hans/`, `/zh-hant/` and `/es/`.
- The pages are generated. Do not edit them by hand. Edit the store copy in `AppStoreMetadata.md` or `captions.json`, then run this from the `underblue-support` clone:
  `python3 -I _build/build_landing.py <path to this repo>`
  - Page titles and the Mac text are in the script itself.
  - The script also rewrites `sitemap.xml`.
  - GitHub Pages does not publish `_build/`.
- The App Store badge links to the iPhone app (`id6815881625`). The Mac section says "coming soon" until `MAC_APP_STORE` is set in the script.
- Search Console:
  - The property is the URL prefix above. A Domain property is not possible on github.io.
  - It is verified by `google98d8e981a7645ba2.html` at the site root. Never delete that file.
  - The sitemap was submitted on 28 Oct 2026. After the submit, the status read "Couldn't fetch".

Both pages are publicly available over HTTPS. Their email addresses are clickable `mailto:` links. The repository's `main` branch blocks force pushes and deletion; only the owner has direct repository access.

## App Privacy declaration

App Store Connect is intentionally configured conservatively as collecting diagnostics because a user may explicitly email a generated report to the developer.

- Data collection: Yes
- Crash Data: collected only when the user explicitly shares a report
- Performance Data: collected only when the user explicitly shares a report
- Other Diagnostic Data: collected only when the user explicitly shares a report
- Purpose: App Functionality (customer support and reliability)
- Linked to the user: No. Set in App Store Connect on 29 Sep 2026 (all four types: App Functionality only). This needs the support process below that keeps a report apart from the sender's email.
- Tracking: No
- Advertising or marketing use: No
- Photos or Videos: collected only when the user explicitly emails a photo or video to support (added 29 Sep 2026)
- Location: Not collected
- Device ID: Not collected
- Automatic upload: No

If a diagnostic attachment is retained together with the sender's email address, mark it as linked to the user. Mark it as not linked only if the support process separates the report from the sender identity and does not attempt to reconnect them. Keep the App Store Connect response and the public privacy policy consistent with the actual support workflow.

## Screenshots and promotional assets

Five uploadable English iPhone screenshots are in `AppStoreAssets/Screenshots/en-US/final`.
Each is a 1320×2868 RGB JPEG without alpha. They were rendered on 29 Sep 2026 from the device
captures in `en-US/source` by `scripts/app_store_screenshots/render.js`. The old `final-v2` set and its
generator were deleted on 24 Oct 2026; they are in git history.

1. `01-before-after.jpg`
2. `02-photo.jpg`
3. `03-video.jpg`
4. `04-looks.jpg`
5. `05-private.jpg`

The first image is an authentic same-frame before/after comparison. The source capture and the corrected capture were produced by the app from developer-owned media. UIEB benchmark images are excluded because the dataset is academic/non-commercial and forbids redistribution.

iPhone Duo screenshots are in `AppStoreAssets/Screenshots/iphone-duo-en-US` (19 Oct 2026). They are raw
captures from the iPhone Duo simulator (iOS 27.1), flattened to RGB PNG without alpha, with the clock fixed at 9:41.
Inner display, 2853×2007: `inner-1-corrected`, `inner-2-original`, `inner-3-batch`. Cover display, 1398×2034:
`outer-1-editor`, `outer-2-home`. The photos come from `DeveloperMedia/eval/real`; confirm they are developer-owned before upload.
There is no video shot: video playback fails on the Duo simulator (see `docs/iPhoneDuoSupportPlan.md`).
The need for Duo-size screenshots is from the plan document and is not checked against App Store Connect.

An App Preview video is optional and is intentionally omitted from the first submission.

The optional 1024×1024 promoted-IAP image is `AppStoreAssets/IAP/UnderBluePro-1024.png`. It is not the
IAP review screenshot. The real purchase-screen review screenshot is
`AppStoreAssets/IAP/UnderBluePro-Review-1206x2622.png`; it shows the production price, feature list,
one-time purchase wording, Restore Purchase and Redeem Code. It is RGB without alpha and matches an
accepted iPhone screenshot size.

## UnderBlue Pro In-App Purchase

- Type: Non-Consumable
- Reference name: `UnderBlue Pro`
- Product ID: `com.underblue.pro`
- English display name: `UnderBlue Pro`
- English description: `Unlimited photos, full video, 4K and HDR`
- Availability: match the app's selected territories
- App Store Server Notifications URL: leave blank; UnderBlue has no server
- Family Sharing: leave off for the first release unless it is explicitly tested and accepted as an irreversible setting

The production price is USD 14.99 (Jake, 29 Sep 2026). The local StoreKit configuration's USD 4.99 value is test data only. The first IAP must be included in the same App Review submission as app version 1.0.

## Remaining App Store Connect work

Jake reported on 29 Sep 2026 that every App Store Connect item except the screenshots was done.
Since then, the local colour source changed; the selected build and screenshots must therefore be
replaced after the release decision above.

- [x] Confirm that the `UnderBlue` name is available and create/verify the app record.
- [x] Confirm the final SKU before creating the record; it cannot be changed afterward.
- [x] Accept the Paid Apps Agreement and complete banking and tax information.
- [x] Complete EU Digital Services Act trader status and any territory-specific compliance questions.
- [x] Choose the app territories; exclude a territory temporarily if App Store Connect requests documentation that is not ready.
- [x] Complete the age-rating questionnaire with no mature, social, advertising, gambling or unrestricted-web content; expected result is 4+.
- [x] Enter the copyright owner using the Apple Developer account's legal name.
- [x] Enter a reachable App Review contact name, email and international-format phone number.
- [x] Create `com.underblue.pro`, choose its production price and tax category, and add its localisation.
- [x] Capture and upload the real UnderBlue Pro purchase-screen review screenshot.
- [ ] Recapture and upload five iPhone screenshots from the accepted final colour source.
- [x] Paste the prepared description, promotional text, keywords and App Review notes.
- [x] Publish the App Privacy answers and verify the Product Page Preview.
- [ ] Upload and select a fresh archive built from the accepted final source. The previously selected
  archive predates the current-source colour changes.
- [x] Add both iOS app version 1.0 and UnderBlue Pro to the same draft submission.

## Before each upload

1. Increase `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` for every build previously uploaded to App Store Connect. Build `1` can be reused only if it has never been uploaded.
2. Increase `MARKETING_VERSION` only when creating a new App Store version.
   Change both numbers in the `UnderBlue` **and** `UnderBlueShare` targets. A mismatch fails App Store validation.
3. Run the physical-device matrices in `QA.md` and `VideoV2QA.md`. For the current colour candidate,
   include m5, at least one Sea-thru-like bright reef, AquaColorFix-like yellow subjects, and a real
   video with changing light. Confirm the photo result and actual video output, not only `uniform`.
4. Select **Any iOS Device (arm64)**, then Product → Archive.
5. In Organizer, run **Validate App** before **Distribute App**.
   Confirm the archive contains `PlugIns/UnderBlueShare.appex`, and that both profiles include the App Group.
6. Retain the archive and dSYM for crash symbolication.
7. Confirm the uploaded build reports iPhone-only device family and no Mac, Catalyst or Vision availability.

Do not upload the existing local archive blindly: create a fresh archive after the latest diagnostics, support-site and platform-setting changes. If build `1` has already reached App Store Connect, increment it before archiving.

## Current local verification

- Generic iOS device Debug build with code signing disabled: succeeded on 29 Sep 2026 after the latest
  colour changes. This proves compilation only; it is not a signed-device run or an archive validation.
- Native macOS colour checks: 72 passed, covering Metal/CPU agreement, reference evidence,
  Original/neutral preservation, colour separation, clipping protection and shadow-channel retention.
- Built-in presets: the tuned Natural, Tropical and Deep Dive looks from `8b9f278` were checked and
  accepted on an iPhone on 29 Sep 2026; `7b1a015` records that result. Recheck only if those values
  or the shared colour pipeline change again.
- Static image evaluation: m5 whole-image CIE76 19.71→17.25 and colour-panel mean 26.89→20.68.
  UIEB dev and holdout means improved slightly; AquaColorFix gate improved slightly.
- Known regressions remain: two m5 photo patches worsened by more than 1 CIE76; UIEB dev
  `114_img_.png` worsened by 2.12 photo / 2.17 uniform, and holdout `144_img_.png` worsened by
  1.53 uniform. Sea-thru generalization is not established.
- App/unit/UI `build-for-testing` and the 44-test functional result belong to an earlier source state.
  They must be rerun after the colour source is accepted. No simulator test was run for this colour task.
- Supported-target build settings verified for Debug; the same settings are generated for Release

## Crash and diagnostics intake

- TestFlight shares available crash reports through Xcode Organizer and App Store Connect TestFlight feedback.
- App Store crash reports appear in Organizer when customers share diagnostics with Apple.
- UnderBlue's MetricKit/error summary remains on the device until the user opens Diagnostics, prepares the JSON report and explicitly shares it.
- The local report includes privacy-safe aggregated photo/video restoration fallback events as well as common import, preview, export, save and purchase failures.
- The report excludes photos, videos, filenames, file paths, location, per-pixel data, raw error descriptions and `userInfo`.
- UnderBlue has no automatic diagnostic upload, analytics backend or automatic support-email transmission.
- Customers should email private diagnostic reports to `support@enheart.me`, not attach them to a public GitHub issue.

## Complimentary Pro access

`com.underblue.pro` is a non-consumable In-App Purchase. After the app is **Ready for Distribution** and the IAP is **Approved**:

1. App Store Connect → Apps → UnderBlue → In-App Purchases.
2. Open UnderBlue Pro and scroll to **Offer Codes**.
3. Create a **Free Offer**, select the intended eligibility groups and territories.
4. For a few friends, create a custom code with a small redemption limit and share its redemption URL. One-time-use batches currently start at 500 codes.
5. Codes can be valid for at most six months. The unlocked non-consumable itself does not expire after redemption.

Customers can redeem a code in the App Store, with its redemption URL, or in UnderBlue: Get Pro → Redeem Code opens Apple's redemption sheet (`offerCodeRedemption`, added 29 Sep 2026). A redeemed code arrives in `Transaction.updates` like a purchase.

Before release, use Sandbox offer codes or TestFlight. Production custom and one-time-use codes are not generated until both the app and IAP are approved.
